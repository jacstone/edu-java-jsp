<h1>Crazy Words - Result</h1>

<p>I went to the store to get <%= request.getAttribute("noun1") %> and 
<%= request.getAttribute("noun2") %> but when I arrived,
I saw a clown trying to <%= request.getAttribute("verb1") %> 
and a dog trying to <%= request.getAttribute("verb2") %>.  It was a strange sight!</p>
